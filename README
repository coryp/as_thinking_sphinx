This version has been modified to work with ActiveScaffold for Rails 3.1

ActiveScaffold Thinking Sphinx Adapter
========

as_thinking_sphinx is a simple adapter to allow the built-in ActiveScaffold search to 
use the Sphinx search engine as well as the default. 

It was created because of the need to search tables with a large number of records.

Prerequisites
========

Sphinx (http://www.sphinxsearch.com/)
Thinking Sphinx (http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/)
ActiveScaffold (http://activescaffold.com/)
	
Installation
========
	
This assumes you already have a working Sphinx installation with the Thinking Sphinx gem 
installed and running.  Your models should already have indexes configured. 

  script/plugin install git://github.com/coryp/as_thinking_sphinx.git

Configuration
=======

In the scaffold controllers in which you would like to use Sphinx, add the following line 
in your active_scaffold config block:

  config.search.engine = 'thinking_sphinx'

That's it!

Super-advanced configuration: If you want to specify the model you will be searching on (since by default it is derived from the current controller), add the following option:

  config.search.model_name = 'product'
